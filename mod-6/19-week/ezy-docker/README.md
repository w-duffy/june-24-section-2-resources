# Ezy Docker

This is a _very simplified_ Dockerfile.  This is intended to roughly compare deploying to render without Docker to deploying to Render with Docker.

---

In the case of adding the Dockerfile to our repo and selecting "Docker" as "Language", Render will use the Dockerfile (right side of the image) to build/start our app instead of the GUI inputs (left side of the image).
