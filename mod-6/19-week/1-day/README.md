# Group Project Planning

We will have time allotted each day this week to work on group project planning!

## **_You will be required to have 4 features for this project, 2 full CRUD and 2 partial CRUD_**

You must produce 3 design documents for approval by your project advisor this week.  All of these docs should be added to your project's wiki on GitHub, and be reviewed by your Instructor there.

- Feature list
- User stories
- Database schema

### [Check out this guide to writing good user stories](https://github.com/seanrioux/user-story-examples)

## Steps to Get Started on the Project

1. Come up with an idea for your project with your group and create a Feature List for Instructor approval. Make sure to get instructor approval on your feature list before continuing on with your other design docs.
2. Start an empty git repository WITHOUT a readme and create a wiki in your repo to hold all of your design docs. Share your wiki with your Instructor.
   - The owner of the repo will also be used as the main scorecard for grading
3. The project starter repo will be released on Friday. Do not start coding until this is released AND you have finished your design docs!

## Optional Design Docs

You do not need to follow this schedule exactly! We prefer to you to take time with your planning - it is ok to turn in your docs after their "due" dates.

Submit your design docs for review by tagging your project lead in your group's discord channel with a link to your GitHub wiki page.

Redux State Shape, API routes, Frontend Routes, and Wire Frames are optional but might be helpful!

## Project Options

You are free to choose between cloning an existing app, creating your own, or something in between!

Possible clones listed in Canvas.

You must use the Python project starter code.

You must have 4 MVP features - at least 2 of which must be full CRUD features.

You may use packages and modules not covered by the App Academy curriculum (React libraries, Flask libraries, etc.), but they must be approved beforehand.

> WARNING: Websockets are a very involved feature! Consider them to be on a similar
> level of difficulty to the Meetup project from before.
