## Accessing Objects and Evaluating Code
- In our HTML files, we use {{ display_item }} to access objects that were passed in as kwargs to render_template
- We use the {% %} syntax to evaluate code within an HTML file
{% for x in items %}
{% endfor %}

{% if condition_a %}
{% elif condition_b %}
{% else condition_c %}
{% endif %}
