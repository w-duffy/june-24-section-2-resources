# Picking a Project
Here are tips and requirements that will help guide you as you choose your capstone project.
## Required
1. Your app should be unique, and not a direct clone of an existing site.
2. **Do not have multiple user roles**.  For example, do not have an "admin user" and a "non-admin user".
3. Do not create an app that is a "game".
## Suggested
1. Build something that you're interested in and passionate about.
2. Create an app that will allow you to add more features and functionality in the future.
3. Build an app that is intuitive and does not require a steep learning curve to understand what it's doing or how it works.
4. Pick a site that is unlike your previous sites.  For instance, if you created a social media site for your Group Project, do not do a social media site for the Capstone.
