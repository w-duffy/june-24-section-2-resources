# AWS S3 Demo

This project includes instructions for setting up AWS via the AWS console.  IT also shows an example implementation of the code for the env, backend and frontend.  Note: the code implementation is purposefully generic and not organized into folders to show that the file structure isn't as important as the actual implementation itself.
