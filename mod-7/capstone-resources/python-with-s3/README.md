# AWS S3 Demo

This project includes instructions for setting up an S3 bucket via the AWS console. It also provides an example implementation of the code for the environment, backend, and frontend.  Note: The code implementation is purposefully generic and not organized into folders to demonstrate that the file structure is less important than the actual implementation.

## Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket

Follow this guide to create a bucket:

- [Guide: Create an S3 Bucket](https://scribehow.com/shared/Create_an_S3_Bucket_and_User_in_AWS__aJhJzta9TZWQyfKvXQd6gQ)

## Step 2: Implement Backend and Frontend Code

Implement the code for the backend and frontend to use the bucket.  Here's an example implementation:

**Frontend:**

* `react-vite/src/redux/aws.js`
* `react-vite/src/components/AWS.jsx`

**Backend:**

* `app/__init__.py`

**Environment:**

* `.env.example`
