# Decode a JWT

In this practice, you will decode a JWT using only basic JavaScript functions.
A sample JWT has been provided for you.

In the __index.js__ file:

1) Split the JWT into 3 parts - the header, the payload, and the signature.
2) Decode the header and payload.
3) Finally, take note of the algorithm and email in the decoded header and
   payload when you run the file. You'll need these to complete the next quiz.
